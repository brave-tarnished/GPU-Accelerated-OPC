# GPU-Accelerated-OPC
Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) is a photolithography technique that modifies photomask geometry to counteract diffraction and process effects, ensuring accurate printing of patterns on the wafer. This work demonstrates a proof of concept showing how using a GPU-based approach can significantly speed up these modifications compared to a CPU.
